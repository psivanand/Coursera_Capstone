BUSINESS PURPOSE:

There is no place like home and the time we miss home most is when we eat food. Our taste palettes crave for something they are used to eating on prolonged exposure to new things no matter how much we deny this fact.

This project aims at helping an Indian Expat explore Indian Restaurants within a city and based on the neighbourhood they are in presents a list of 10 best Indian Restaurants which can be their go to when their stomachs are home sick. 

The Project Analyses a few of the major cities in the world as an initial phase. The cities chose for this are:

1.	Toronto, Canada
2.	New York City, USA
